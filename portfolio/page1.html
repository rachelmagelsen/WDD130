                <p>Here’s where you can find some illustrations I did for a book project called I Love You My Boy. This project was commissioned by a member of my church back at home. The woman who commissioned me is a mother of three boys, and though it would be nice to write a book that showed her boys growing up. Each page has the words “I love you, my boy, for you are…” with my illustration finishing the sentence. It was a fun project to work on, although it took me a while to do. I was working on it while in school, and it took me just under a year to finish. The full project was 15 illustrations, not including sketches and alternate versions for each final illustration. For this project, I tried to focus on bright and warm colors, especially oranges and reds, with blue and green accents. The client loved my images and the book can now be purchased on Amazon.</p>
