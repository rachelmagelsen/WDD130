        Hi, I’m Rachel Magelsen! I’m a freelance illustrator and I’m glad you’ve visited my site. Here, you can view my artwork, my art portfolio, and pieces from past illustration projects.

Find my information below and feel free to reach out. I’d love to hear about any projects you might have.

Have any questions about my current projects? Go to the pages for those projects and learn more. Anything you’d like to know about me? Again, feel free to contact me and I’m more than willing to answer your questions.

      <h3>I Love You My Boy</h3>
      <p>
        Here’s where you can find some illustrations I did for a book project called I Love You My Boy. This project was commissioned by a member of my church back at home. The woman who commissioned me is a mother of three boys, and though it would be nice to write a book that showed her boys growing up. Each page has the words “I love you, my boy, for you are…” with my illustration finishing the sentence. It was a fun project to work on, although it took me a while to do. I was working on it while in school, and it took me just under a year to finish. The full project was 15 illustrations, not including sketches and alternate versions for each final illustration. For this project, I tried to focus on bright and warm colors, especially oranges and reds, with blue and green accents. The client loved my images and the book can now be purchased on Amazon.

      <h3>Once There Was A Girl</h3>
      <p>
        This page is dedicated to my current book illustration commission project for my great aunt, who wrote a book of stories about her growing up called Once There Was A Girl. It’s been really nice to read about her life as I’ve worked on this project, and see how it connects to life today. She plans on printing this book and making enough copies to give to her children and grandchildren as gifts, which has motivated me to make my illustrations special for her. Unlike other commission projects I’ve worked on, I have had a lot of freedom in the creative aspects of this project, with little directions from my client. I was provided with example images, but much of the subject matter involves some research, which has been fun! I have been focusing more on bubbly, exciting colors and poses, trying to add a bit of maturity to my illustrations compared to other projects I’ve done.
