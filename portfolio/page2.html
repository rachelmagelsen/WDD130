            <h1>Once There Was A Girl</h1>
            <p>This page is dedicated to my current book illustration commission project for my great aunt, who wrote a book of stories about her growing up. It’s been really nice to read about her life as I’ve worked on this project, and see how it connects to life today. She plans on printing this book and making enough copies to give to her children and grandchildren as gifts, which has motivated me to make my illustrations special for her. Unlike other commission projects I’ve worked on, I have had a lot of freedom in the creative aspects of this project, with little directions from my client. I was provided with example images, but much of the subject matter involves some research, which has been fun! I have been focusing more on bubbly, exciting colors and poses, trying to add a bit of maturity to my illustrations compared to other projects I’ve done.</p>
